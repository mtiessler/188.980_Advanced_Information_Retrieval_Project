# We use the ir-metadata standard to describe and process runs.
# The fields below are mandatory, you can add additional metadata if you like.
# There are two libraries that automate and simplify tracking of experimental metadata that you can use optionally:
#
#   - The metadata module of [repro_eval](https://www.ir-metadata.org/software/):
#     Tracks the platform and implementation of your experiments.
#
#   - The [tirex_tracker](https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker/):
#     Tracks the platform, implementation, and resources (e.g., CPU, GPU, RAM, emissions, etc.) of your experiments.
#
# See https://www.ir-metadata.org for more details.

  description: |
    This is a basic BM25 retrieval system for the Longeval-Sci task.
    The BM25 implementation utilizes NLTK for tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming.

implementation:
  source:
    # Please provide a reference to your code if possible.
    # If you can not share your code, you can delete the implementation section.
    # The repro_eval and/or tirex_tracker tools can track this automatically, including commits, branches, etc.
    repository: no reference to code available

platform:
  software:
  
    # Which software and tools did you use for training, tunning and running your system?
    # You can maintain the software that you used manually.
    # Alternatively, you can use repro_eval or the tirex_tracker to track this.
